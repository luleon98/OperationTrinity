# Grocery Checklist Project

## Overview
* The checklist will allow me to add, track, update, and delete a list of the groceries I need. I am building this for the sole reason to keep track of my grocery needs without having to go into my Notes app as I am tired of the basic Apple layout of its Notes. I will build this Checklist on AWS using different services, including: DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, S3, Cloudfront, and Cognito. Maybe more.
